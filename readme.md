# Welcome to the Backup Buddy!
The Backup Buddy is an Automated Backup Tool written by me for my Champlain College Capstone Project. 

### What is the Backup Buddy?
The Backup Buddy is an Automated Backup Tool written in PowerShell. I designed the Backup Buddy to be the one-stop shop for hassle-free backups of both your important filesystems as well as your vSphere environment. It features a robust User Interface and an easy-to-follow command line experience. 

### How do I install and use the Backup Buddy?
Simple! Download this repository and extract it, then run the `backupbuddy-menu.ps1` , and then select "Reconfigure Settings" in the menu. You can configure the Backup Buddy and start running automated backups!


#### Backup Buddy Pre-Reqs
The Backup Buddy requires a couple other PowerShell modules and programs to be installed in order to function. 

* `PSScriptMenuGui`
* `VMware PowerCLI`
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org)

Running the Menu script without the PowerShell modules installed will prompt you to install them. You can follow the above link to install 7-Zip if you haven't already. In order to correctly use the Backup Buddy, the above modules and programs must be installed beforehand.
